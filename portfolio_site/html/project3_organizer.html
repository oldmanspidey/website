<p><h4>GMU Overwatch Social Media Manager, 2018-</h4></p>

<p>Starting in the 2018-2019 academic year, I began my role as Social Media Manager for GMU Overwatch, planning and enacting the team’s online presence across various social media platforms, mainly focusing on <a href="https://twitter.com/GMUOverwatch">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX4rGir3J9aKFI6zUuTBAwQ">YouTube</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gmuoverwatch/">Instagram</a>. This included utilizing my skills as a graphic designer to create visual graphics with a coherent aesthetic across platforms in order to instill team familiarity with online audiences. Additionally, I helped curate, and in some cases create, short-form and long-form video content with our team editors, including gameplay montages, interviews, and meme content.</p>

<p>I also designed and created the branding and visual graphics for the Virginia Community Overwatch Invitational (VCOI), an in-state tournament between VA colleges and universities hosted by GMU Overwatch.</p>

<p><h4>GMU Overwatch Outreach Manager, 2019-</h4></p>

<p>An additional role within the GMU Overwatch team I took on was that of Outreach Manager, creating connections and networking between the team and outside organizations, schools, and individuals. I helped both GMU Overwatch and Esports partner and participate in events with Washington Vice & Virtue, Washington Justice, and Team Liquid. In preparation for VCOI, I coordinated the participation of other Virginia schools, as well as secure casters for the tournament.</p>

<p><h4>GAMEmason 2019 Planning Committee, 2019</h4></p>

<p>Starting in 2018, Student Involvement at George Mason University set out, with the help of various student groups, to create GAMEmason, an on-campus event that would engage students by covering various fields relating to gaming - ranging from esports to game development, and everything in between. On the planning committee for this event, I served as both a participant and liaison between the committee and GMU Overwatch, helping to coordinate the in-person LAN finals of the Virginia Community Overwatch Invitational tournament that would serve as the capstone to GAMEmason’s event day lineup.</p>

<p>The event, which took place on April 5th, 2019, also included celebrity appearances from David Hayter and John Romero, a public game floor, a Mason Smash crew battle, and other attractions. GAMEmason 2019 surpassed attendance expectations by over double the amount of attendees, making the event a resounding success and putting a spotlight on GMU Esports.</p>
